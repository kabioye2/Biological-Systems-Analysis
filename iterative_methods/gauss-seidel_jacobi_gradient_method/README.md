Introduction
Part one uses different iterative solves to solve for three set of equations. Iterative methods are
used when Gauss elimination canâ€™t be used or less efficient. The iterative methods used were
Gradient, Gauss-Seidel, and Jacobi method. Part two involves visualizing linesearch to display a
2D section of the curve.

Conclusion
Different iterative methods were used to solve for the equations. The same solution resulted for
each equation. Linesearch used to plot a 2D plot of the contour plot. This helps to see the
solution easily.

Discussion
Iterative methods were studied more in this assignment because it is a useful tool when solving
for system of equations. Real world set of equations will be more extensive and this is where
iterative methods come into play.
