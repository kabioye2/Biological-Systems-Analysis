Iterative methods for solving linear algebraic equations

Introduction
Gauss elimination was used to find the solution to the algebraic system of equations manually.
Once the solutions were found by hand, iterative methods were used in MATLAB to verify the
solutions. The iterative methods used was Gradient, Gauss-Seidel, and Jacobi methods. A
contour map and residual surface map was plotted for the first two set of equations. Five initial
guesses were used to show convergence to the same solution, x.

Results
Problem 1:
The solutions for the equations 1-3 using Gauss elimination is as follows:
x = [2; 1] for equation 1
x = [14/5; 2/5] for equation 2
x = [1; 1.5; 2.5] for equation 3

Conclusion
Gauss elimination was used to find solutions for the first three problems. Then the Gradient
method was used to find the solutions to equations one and two, Gauss-Seidel method was used
to find the solutions for equations 1, 2, and 3, and the Jacobi method was used to solve for
equation 3. The solutions for each method were the same for each equation. The Gauss-Seidel
method required less iterations over the Jacobi method.

Discussion
Gauss elimination can be used to find solutions to less complex equations. The methods used in
the homework will come in handy for more complex equations or solutions. Each method has
their own benefit.
