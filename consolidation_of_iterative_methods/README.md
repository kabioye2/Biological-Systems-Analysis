# Consolidation-of-Iterative-Methods

Introduction
This assignment focuses on solving equations with iterative methods as done in other
assignments. Two new iterative methods are introduced: Conjugate Gradient and NewtonRaphson methods. The Gauss-Seidal method was also used. Convergence histories were also
plotted with different initial x.

Conclusion
Iterative methods were used to find solutions for system of equations. Newton-Raphson was a
new iterative method introduced. Gauss-Seidel and Gradient were also used. Gauss-Seidal was
also done by hand.

Discussion
Iterative methods have proven its importance once again. Solving system of equations is
important in modeling various biological systems.
